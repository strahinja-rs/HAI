# HAI — Status

**Status:** Active
**Started:** 2026-01-30

## Objective

Build deep expertise in Human-AI Interaction and produce published work from it.

## Current State

Session 4 complete — Finished reading "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" (all sections). 13 concept notes now in 3-Concepts/. Vault system synced (tags, templates, CLAUDE.md workflows). Concept creation and retrieval protocols formalized.

## Recent Progress

- Finished first foundational reading (Mapping the HAI Field — Gemini synthesis)
- 8 new concept notes created (Session 4): AI-Whisperers, Stochastic-Epistemology, Cognitive-Forcing-Functions, Adjustable-Autonomy, Anthropomorphism-in-HAI, Warm-Transparency, Turn-Based-Interface, Chat-as-Interaction-Pattern
- 2 existing notes updated: Friction-Discernment (CFF distinction, ontological design), Interaction-Field (embodiment test, human lens, extension-vs-field)
- Vault system overhaul: synced TAGS.md, updated concept template, standardized tags across all notes
- Formalized workflows in CLAUDE.md: concept creation (end of session), retrieval protocol (start of session, status-based), reading notes vs. log distinction

## In Progress

- [x] Reading: "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" — **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)

## Next Actions

- [ ] Read "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" synthesis
- [ ] Conference decisions by Feb 10-11 (CHI workshops, IUI)
- [ ] Read Microsoft HAX Toolkit and Google PAIR Guidebook (priority practitioner reading)
- [ ] Watch: Arrival (2016) — connects to AI Whisperers concept
- [ ] Next session: retrieval exercise on all 13 seed concepts

## Scope

All modes of human-AI contact: relating, thinking with, creating with, delegating to, learning from.
