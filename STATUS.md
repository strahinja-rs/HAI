# HAI — Status

**Status:** Active
**Started:** 2026-01-30

## Objective

Build deep expertise in Human-AI Interaction and produce published work from it.

## Current State

Session 5 complete — Research process formalized and documented. Evaluated Gemini Deep Research as a tool (ran it on itself), compared Gemini vs Claude research outputs, developed the full research workflow (Meta/Research-Process.md). Methodology research launched — output received, queued for next session. 13 concept notes in vault, no new concepts this session (process-focused session).

## Recent Progress

- Formalized the HAI research process (`Meta/Research-Process.md`) — question types, tool roles, meta-prompt strategy, reading/processing workflow
- Evaluated Gemini Deep Research in depth: mechanism, control surfaces, limitations (snippet trap), comparison with Claude Research
- Compared Gemini vs Claude research outputs (`1-Inbox/Comparison-Gemini-vs-Claude-Research.md`)
- Launched methodology research (qualitative/practice-based methods for practitioner-researchers)
- Surfaced micro-phenomenology and Peter Dalsgaard (Aarhus) as research methodology leads
- Updated CLAUDE.md: interaction policy #6 (write substantial text to files)
- Identified phenomenological inquiry as natural research lens

## In Progress

- [x] Reading: "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" — **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)
- [ ] Methodology research report — received, not yet read

## Next Actions

- [ ] Read and process methodology research report (priority — next session)
- [ ] Retrieval exercise on 13 seed concepts (skipped Session 5)
- [ ] Read "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" synthesis
- [ ] Find and read micro-phenomenology paper (Dalsgaard et al.)
- [ ] Conference decisions by Feb 10-11 (CHI workshops, IUI)
- [ ] Read Microsoft HAX Toolkit and Google PAIR Guidebook
- [ ] Watch: Arrival (2016) — connects to AI Whisperers concept

## Scope

All modes of human-AI contact: relating, thinking with, creating with, delegating to, learning from.
