# HAI — Status

**Status:** Active
**Started:** 2026-01-30

## Objective

Build deep expertise in Human-AI Interaction and produce published work from it.

## Current State

Session 3 complete — First concept notes created. Retrieval exercise confirmed strong retention of Session 2 observations. Five concept notes now in 3-Concepts/. Guidance app introduced as real-world anchor.

## Recent Progress

- Project initialized, vault structure, CLAUDE.md, templates, tags, MOCs
- Reading session workflow established
- 5 concept notes created: Mechanistic-Interpretability, User-Interpretability, Intent-Expression-Atrophy, Friction-Discernment, Interaction-Field
- Retrieval exercise protocol tested and working
- Guidance app added as real-world anchor (friction discernment, interaction field, file-first AI-native architecture)
- Process observation: voice dictation as higher-fidelity channel for first expression

## In Progress

- [ ] Reading: "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" — through Sec 2, next: Sec 3 (Modes of Interaction)
- [ ] Queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)

## Next Actions

- [ ] Continue reading Mapping the HAI Field from Section 3
- [ ] Conference decisions by Feb 10-11 (CHI workshops, IUI)
- [ ] Read Interaction Design synthesis
- [ ] Process both into SRC- source notes
- [ ] Queued concept candidates: AI Whisperers, Stochastic Epistemology

## Scope

All modes of human-AI contact: relating, thinking with, creating with, delegating to, learning from.
