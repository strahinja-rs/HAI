# HAI — Status

**Status:** Active
**Started:** 2026-01-30

## Objective

Build deep expertise in Human-AI Interaction and produce published work from it.

## Current State

Session 6 complete — Read and processed Gemini methodology report (qualitative research frameworks for HAI). Created 3 new concept notes (Enactivism, Augmentation-Modes, Autobiographical-Design), bringing vault to 16 concepts (all seeds). Defined all frontmatter fields precisely (Meta/Field-Definitions.md). Updated Research-Process.md with qualitative methods section. Created 2 source notes (methodology report + field map). Major inbox clearing — 18 items processed, 9 remaining. Retrieval exercise on 4 seeds — all consolidating.

## Recent Progress

- Read and processed methodology research report → source note `SRC-Gemini-2026-Qualitative-Research-Frameworks-HAI.md`
- Created source note for field map: `SRC-Gemini-2026-Mapping-Human-AI-Interaction-Field.md`
- Created 3 concept notes: Enactivism, Augmentation-Modes (original), Autobiographical-Design
- Defined all frontmatter fields precisely (`Meta/Field-Definitions.md`)
- Updated `Meta/Research-Process.md` with qualitative methods section (decision matrix, trustworthiness criteria, pitfalls)
- Retrieval exercise on 4 seeds: Friction-Discernment, Stochastic-Epistemology, Turn-Based-Interface, Warm-Transparency — all consolidating
- Cleared 18 items from inbox
- Registered for EPIC2026 Kickoff (Feb 4, online)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: field definitions reference, less conservative concept note creation policy

## In Progress

- [x] Reading: "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" — **COMPLETE**
- [x] Reading: Methodology research report — **COMPLETE**
- [ ] Queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)

## Scope

All modes of human-AI contact: relating, thinking with, creating with, delegating to, learning from.
