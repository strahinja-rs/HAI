But do I really really need specific books/articles if I have Gemini Deep Research? Or is this just a matter of deep skill with that tool and all the combinations for pulling out and synthesizing information from the internet with proper context engineering? 

Good research prompt can do so much.

Also multiple research prompts that are read/analyzed against each other.
