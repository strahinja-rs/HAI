**Research goal:** Map the landscape of qualitative and practice-based research methodologies that are relevant for a non-academic practitioner-researcher entering the field of Human-AI Interaction. I need to understand which established research traditions support specific kinds of inquiry — particularly phenomenological, experiential, and design-oriented research — and what each tradition says about rigor, validity, and common pitfalls.

Act as a research methodology advisor helping someone with deep practitioner experience (product management, design, building products) but no formal academic research training to understand which methodological traditions fit their natural mode of inquiry.

**Scope:** Focus on qualitative and practice-based research traditions relevant to HCI and Human-AI Interaction specifically. Include both established traditions (phenomenology, grounded theory, action research, etc.) and newer approaches emerging in the AI era. Prioritize practical understanding over philosophical depth — I need to know what each approach does, when to use it, and what it demands, not its full intellectual history. Time frame: foundational texts plus 2020-2026 developments.

**Context about the researcher:**
- Non-academic background: product management, SaaS, tech media, startup ecosystems
- Currently building expertise in Human-AI Interaction through self-directed study
- Natural research mode is phenomenological: encounters material, reacts from lived experience, names patterns and structures that others haven't articulated
- Builds products (iOS apps, AI tools) that test HAI concepts in practice
- Strengths: pattern recognition, precise articulation, seeing "the gap between the story and the structure"
- Weaknesses: no formal research training, no familiarity with methodological conventions, risk of reinventing existing frameworks without knowing it

**I need the following, in this structure:**

1. **Map of Qualitative Research Traditions** — A comprehensive overview of the major qualitative and practice-based research methodologies. For each tradition: what it studies, how it works, what kind of knowledge it produces, what it demands from the researcher, and what its known limitations are. Include at minimum:
   - Phenomenology (descriptive and interpretive)
   - Autoethnography
   - Grounded Theory
   - Action Research / Participatory Action Research
   - Design Research / Research Through Design
   - Case Study research
   - Ethnography (traditional and digital)
   - Practitioner Research / Practice-Based Research
   - Any emerging methodologies specific to HCI or AI research (e.g., AI-mediated ethnography, computational qualitative methods)

2. **Which Traditions Fit Which Questions** — A practical decision framework: given a specific kind of research question (landscape, analytical, phenomenological, design-oriented, adversarial), which methodology is appropriate? When would a practitioner-researcher use each one? Include concrete examples from HCI/HAI research.

3. **Rigor Without Academia** — What does "rigor" mean in each tradition? How does a non-academic practitioner-researcher maintain credibility and validity? What are the standards for evidence, documentation, and argumentation in each tradition? Specifically address: Can someone outside academia do legitimate research? What does that look like? What are the precedents?

4. **Common Pitfalls for Self-Taught Researchers** — What goes wrong when someone researches without methodological training? Confirmation bias, cherry-picking, unfalsifiable claims, conflating personal experience with generalizable findings, reinventing existing concepts, etc. Be specific and practical.

5. **The Phenomenological Lens in HCI/HAI** — Since phenomenological inquiry appears to be this researcher's natural mode: What does phenomenological research look like in HCI specifically? Who does it? What has it produced? How is it regarded relative to quantitative and experimental approaches? What are its specific strengths and weaknesses for studying human-AI interaction?

6. **Research Through Making** — The researcher builds products (an iOS practice timer, AI decision support tools) that embody HAI concepts. Is "research through making" a recognized methodology? What does it require to be legitimate research rather than just product development? How does it relate to design research traditions?

7. **Practical Starting Points** — Given this researcher's profile, what are the 3-5 most important things to read or understand about research methodology? Not a full curriculum — the minimum viable methodological literacy for someone doing the kind of work described.

**Constraints:** Cite sources for all factual claims. Distinguish between established consensus and emerging/contested positions. Prioritize HCI and HAI examples over generic social science examples. Avoid condescension toward non-academic research — treat practitioner research as legitimate while being honest about its limitations. Exclude purely quantitative and experimental methods (not relevant to this researcher's mode).
