Also the question of using Claude for research. I feel like it doesn't do as good of a job as Gemini. I feel like Claude Research is sometimes smarter and creative in synthesis but it feels like it simply is not precise and comprehensive enough in the sources. Google is simply more powerful in research.

But the open question is: should I always use both? Should I always run the same research prompt on both so I have like two points of view? Ofc each prompt written so it's appropriate for each tool, but the same research goal.
