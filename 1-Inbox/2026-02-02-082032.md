Okay, let me see what comes up during my walk to the coffee shop, where I’ll work on the research. There are many human minds working on numerous topics, and the latent space is infinite; reality is so complex that no single perspective is enough. I have chosen human‑AI interaction as my field these days. It’s broad enough to include many things I care about. It’s direct, active, and recursive. Do I have something to offer? Do I have something to give? Is my way of processing, my way of being, unique enough to produce value for the world? Can I clarify something for the world simply by being myself and doing what I do?
