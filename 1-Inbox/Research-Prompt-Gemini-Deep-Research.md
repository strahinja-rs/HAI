**Research goal:** Produce a comprehensive practitioner's guide to Google Gemini Deep Research — not a product review, but a detailed map of its capabilities, mechanisms, limitations, and advanced usage patterns.

Act as a technical research methods specialist documenting a new research instrument.

**Scope:** Focus on Gemini Deep Research specifically (the multi-step research mode, not standard Gemini chat). Include information from launch through the most recent updates (2025-2026). Prioritize practitioner reports, power user techniques, and technical documentation over marketing materials.

**I need the following, in this structure:**

1. **Mechanism** — How Deep Research actually works: the search-synthesize-iterate loop, how many sources it typically consults, how it decides search queries, how it handles conflicting information, how it determines when research is "complete." Any available technical details on architecture.

2. **Control surfaces** — What the user can influence through prompting: output format, source types, depth of analysis, geographic/temporal scope, synthesis style, citation behavior. What aspects of the research process are NOT controllable by the user.

3. **Failure modes and limitations** — Documented weaknesses: source hallucination rates, synthesis depth ceiling, recency bias, topic areas where it performs poorly, known blindspots. How it handles ambiguity and contested claims.

4. **Advanced usage patterns** — Techniques discovered by power users: prompt structures that produce qualitatively different outputs, multi-prompt research workflows (running sequential or parallel prompts that build on each other), strategies for steering synthesis vs. aggregation, methods for verifying and extending its outputs.

5. **Comparison with other research tools** — How Deep Research differs from Claude Research, Perplexity Pro, and manual academic literature review (Google Scholar + reading papers). Specific strengths and weaknesses relative to each. Not a ranking — a capability map.

6. **The possibility space** — What types of research tasks is this tool genuinely good for? Where should a researcher NOT rely on it? What workflows combine it with other tools for maximum coverage?

**Constraints:** Cite sources for all factual claims. Distinguish between documented/verified capabilities and user-reported anecdotes. Flag anything that may have changed with recent updates. Exclude surface-level "tips and tricks" content — I need depth.
