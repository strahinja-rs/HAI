# Session: 2026-02-01

## Who
- Strahinja, 30, non-academic background (product management, SaaS, e-commerce, tech media, NGOs, startup accelerators, EU programs)
- Currently building apps (vibe coding)
- Insecure about academic credentials but brings real-world experience
- Wants personalized guidance, not generic academic tone

## What We're Doing
- Reading through foundational HAI field overviews from 1-Inbox
- Started with "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" (Gemini research)
- Second file queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)

## Workflow Established
- Read in Obsidian, dump questions in `1-Inbox/Reading notes.md` (working surface, clear after processing)
- Bring question batches to Claude in terminal
- Keep own thoughts/reactions in reading notes (don't clear those)
- Create concept notes AFTER finishing a reading, not during
- Spaced repetition: decide later once concept library has mass

## Collaboration Rules (from CLAUDE.md)
- Claude: infrastructure, navigation, scaffolding, questions, editing
- Human: understanding, synthesis, judgment, voice, creation
- Do NOT synthesize or write original analysis for him

## Clarifications Covered
- Ontological transformation = field changed its fundamental nature, not just grew
- Recommender systems = "you might also like" features
- ML interpretability (pre-2022) = explaining decisions to users (UX concern)
- Mechanistic interpretability = understanding model internals (safety/science concern)
- High-velocity field = moves fast, papers outdated in months
- Industrial white papers = company-published research, not peer-reviewed

## Human Observations (keep these — original thinking)
- The three HAI epochs (Explainability → Generative → Agentic) stack rather than replace. Each phase inherits the problems of the previous one and adds new layers. Trust calibration doesn't disappear when agents arrive — it gets harder.
- Intent is bidirectional: human specifies intent to AI (intent specification), AI reads/infers intent from human (intent reading). The quality of the full loop — specification, reading, translation — determines interaction quality. Could frame as "intent exchange."
- Direct Manipulation → new paradigm feels "more wave, more indirect." Not cause-and-effect but negotiation. Output is probabilistic, not deterministic.
- **Key formulation:** "From working on the thing to working on the relationships between things that produce the thing." Also: "You're not writing anymore, you're designing the writers." The shift to agentic AI means working on relationships between things, not on the things themselves. Higher complexity demands holistic attention — sensing the system rather than controlling parts. McGilchrist's left/right hemisphere lens (parts vs. wholes, manipulation vs. relationship) may map onto Direct Manipulation → Intent Specification → Agentic Orchestration.
- **Concept candidate:** Friction Discernment — the meta-skill of choosing where to keep friction and where to eliminate it. Goes beyond UI cognitive forcing functions into a life skill for the automation age. Connects to: cognitive forcing functions (Sec 4.3), intent expression atrophy, over-reliance.
- "What you mean vs what you said" — the gap may be the gap between partially formed and fully formed intent. Connects to intent expression atrophy observation. Labeled for further exploration.
- **Seed (analysis-level):** "AI whisperers" — some cognitive dispositions (comfort with ambiguity, iterative refinement, loose intent-holding) may make certain people naturally better at human-AI interaction. Already visible in data: frontier workers at 95th percentile use AI qualitatively differently, not just more. Social implications of a new class stratification based on AI interaction aptitude. Arrival analogy: Louise Banks as the archetype. Open question: learnable skill or innate disposition?
- **Seed (analysis-level):** The interaction field — human-AI interaction as a single entity/field, not two separate entities exchanging messages. Total intelligence of the field is determined by both participants. Analogy from relational therapy: the session itself is an entity. Goes beyond "distributed agency" (still implies two separate actors) toward something more unified. Connects to: extended cognition (Clark & Chalmers), intersubjective field (therapy traditions), human-AI symbiosis (Paper 2). Open question: does this require consciousness on both sides to be real, or does it work with one conscious + one responsive participant?
- **Seed (analysis-level):** Technological foundations shape epistemology and culture. Deterministic tools → deterministic worldview (mechanistic, cause-and-effect). What happens when the foundational tools become probabilistic/stochastic? Does culture shift from certainty-seeking to ambiguity-tolerant? Historical parallels: clockwork→mechanism, computing→information processing, networks→decentralization, stochastic AI→? Connects to philosophy of technology (McLuhan, Postman, Yuk Hui).
- Verifiability irony: problems with clear, verifiable outputs are easiest to evaluate AND easiest for AI to solve alone. Problems needing human-AI collaboration (ambiguous, contextual) are hardest to evaluate. The evaluation gap is widest where it matters most.
- Evaluation has the same "thing → relationships" shift: you can't evaluate a dynamic relationship with a snapshot. Tools built for snapshots, measuring a process. This is the methodological crisis.
- **Key formulation:** "Synthetic personas are good for known problem spaces at scale, human research is irreplaceable for emerging experiences." Complementary tools, not replacements.
- Intent expression atrophy hypothesis: As AI gets better at reading intent from minimal input, users lose practice (and eventually capacity) for precise intent expression. Self-reinforcing cycle. Noticed in own behavior ("the AI will figure it out"). Related to cognitive offloading but distinct: offloading navigation loses a skill, but offloading intent expression may lose access to *what you actually want*. Position taken: expression is constitutive of intent, not just its output. If you can't express your intent, it's not fully yours — you don't know it. "Expression is the scene." Connects to: cognitive offloading, cognitive forcing functions (Sec 4.3), control-autonomy paradox (Sec 5.3), over-reliance.

## Concepts Created (Session 3)
- ✅ [[Mechanistic-Interpretability]] + [[User-Interpretability]] (split into two notes)
- ✅ [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]]
- ✅ [[Friction-Discernment]]
- ✅ [[Interaction-Field]]
- Queued: AI Whisperers, Stochastic Epistemology — depending on how they develop

## Process Observation
- Voice dictation vs. typing: voice is the channel for first expression (truer, more connected to inner speech), keyboard is for sculpting/editing. Dictated concept descriptions were sharper than written Session 2 versions. Friction discernment in action — but open question: choosing the higher-fidelity channel, or rationalizing comfort? Be mindful.
- Meta-observation: studying friction discernment as theory while practicing it in the research process itself. The research subject and the research method are entangled.

## Reading List (surfaced from this session)

## Session 3 (Feb 1, afternoon)

### What We Did
- Retrieval exercise on 4 concept candidates from Session 2
- Created 5 concept notes: [[Mechanistic-Interpretability]], [[User-Interpretability]], [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]], [[Friction-Discernment]], [[Interaction-Field]]
- Introduced Guidance app (`~/Projects/myProtocols/`) as real-world anchor — added to CLAUDE.md
- Moved 2 iCloud backlog captures to inbox (primary orality detection, AI critiques written with AI)

### Retrieval Results
- Intent Expression Atrophy: strong — extended the formulation ("externalizing self-knowledge, disintegrating rather than integrating")
- Friction Discernment: strong — gym analogy, Phaedrus reference, cognitive friction distinction all recalled
- Interaction Field: core solid, therapy analogy recalled, philosophical connections (extended mind, open questions) lighter
- User Interpretability: fuzzy — needed prompting to recover the definition
- Mechanistic Interpretability: solid

### Inbox State
- Unprocessed: 2 iCloud captures (primary orality, AI critiques observation), conferences 2026, 3 research syntheses, 2 epubs (McGilchrist, Shneiderman), Reading notes.md
- No items cleared this session (no reading processing occurred)

## Between Sessions
- Kindle: Reading McGilchrist's *The Master and His Emissary*
- Next session: Section 3 of Mapping the HAI Field
- Conference deadlines approaching: Feb 12 CHI workshops, Feb 13 IUI
