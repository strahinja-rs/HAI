# Session: 2026-02-01

## Who
- Strahinja, 30, non-academic background (product management, SaaS, e-commerce, tech media, NGOs, startup accelerators, EU programs)
- Currently building apps (vibe coding)
- Insecure about academic credentials but brings real-world experience
- Wants personalized guidance, not generic academic tone

## What We're Doing
- Reading through foundational HAI field overviews from 1-Inbox
- Started with "Mapping the Human-AI Interaction Field" (Gemini research)
- Second file queued: "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" (Claude research)

## Workflow Established
- Read in Obsidian, dump questions in `1-Inbox/Reading notes.md` (working surface, clear after processing)
- Bring question batches to Claude in terminal
- Keep own thoughts/reactions in reading notes (don't clear those)
- Create concept notes AFTER finishing a reading, not during
- Spaced repetition: decide later once concept library has mass

## Collaboration Rules (from CLAUDE.md)
- Claude: infrastructure, navigation, scaffolding, questions, editing
- Human: understanding, synthesis, judgment, voice, creation
- Do NOT synthesize or write original analysis for him

## Clarifications Covered
- Ontological transformation = field changed its fundamental nature, not just grew
- Recommender systems = "you might also like" features
- ML interpretability (pre-2022) = explaining decisions to users (UX concern)
- Mechanistic interpretability = understanding model internals (safety/science concern)
- High-velocity field = moves fast, papers outdated in months
- Industrial white papers = company-published research, not peer-reviewed

## Human Observations (keep these — original thinking)
- The three HAI epochs (Explainability → Generative → Agentic) stack rather than replace. Each phase inherits the problems of the previous one and adds new layers. Trust calibration doesn't disappear when agents arrive — it gets harder.
- Intent is bidirectional: human specifies intent to AI (intent specification), AI reads/infers intent from human (intent reading). The quality of the full loop — specification, reading, translation — determines interaction quality. Could frame as "intent exchange."
- Direct Manipulation → new paradigm feels "more wave, more indirect." Not cause-and-effect but negotiation. Output is probabilistic, not deterministic.
- **Key formulation:** "From working on the thing to working on the relationships between things that produce the thing." Also: "You're not writing anymore, you're designing the writers." The shift to agentic AI means working on relationships between things, not on the things themselves. Higher complexity demands holistic attention — sensing the system rather than controlling parts. McGilchrist's left/right hemisphere lens (parts vs. wholes, manipulation vs. relationship) may map onto Direct Manipulation → Intent Specification → Agentic Orchestration.
- **Concept candidate:** Friction Discernment — the meta-skill of choosing where to keep friction and where to eliminate it. Goes beyond UI cognitive forcing functions into a life skill for the automation age. Connects to: cognitive forcing functions (Sec 4.3), intent expression atrophy, over-reliance.
- "What you mean vs what you said" — the gap may be the gap between partially formed and fully formed intent. Connects to intent expression atrophy observation. Labeled for further exploration.
- **Seed (analysis-level):** "AI whisperers" — some cognitive dispositions (comfort with ambiguity, iterative refinement, loose intent-holding) may make certain people naturally better at human-AI interaction. Already visible in data: frontier workers at 95th percentile use AI qualitatively differently, not just more. Social implications of a new class stratification based on AI interaction aptitude. Arrival analogy: Louise Banks as the archetype. Open question: learnable skill or innate disposition?
- **Seed (analysis-level):** The interaction field — human-AI interaction as a single entity/field, not two separate entities exchanging messages. Total intelligence of the field is determined by both participants. Analogy from relational therapy: the session itself is an entity. Goes beyond "distributed agency" (still implies two separate actors) toward something more unified. Connects to: extended cognition (Clark & Chalmers), intersubjective field (therapy traditions), human-AI symbiosis (Paper 2). Open question: does this require consciousness on both sides to be real, or does it work with one conscious + one responsive participant?
- **Seed (analysis-level):** Technological foundations shape epistemology and culture. Deterministic tools → deterministic worldview (mechanistic, cause-and-effect). What happens when the foundational tools become probabilistic/stochastic? Does culture shift from certainty-seeking to ambiguity-tolerant? Historical parallels: clockwork→mechanism, computing→information processing, networks→decentralization, stochastic AI→? Connects to philosophy of technology (McLuhan, Postman, Yuk Hui).
- Verifiability irony: problems with clear, verifiable outputs are easiest to evaluate AND easiest for AI to solve alone. Problems needing human-AI collaboration (ambiguous, contextual) are hardest to evaluate. The evaluation gap is widest where it matters most.
- Evaluation has the same "thing → relationships" shift: you can't evaluate a dynamic relationship with a snapshot. Tools built for snapshots, measuring a process. This is the methodological crisis.
- **Key formulation:** "Synthetic personas are good for known problem spaces at scale, human research is irreplaceable for emerging experiences." Complementary tools, not replacements.
- Intent expression atrophy hypothesis: As AI gets better at reading intent from minimal input, users lose practice (and eventually capacity) for precise intent expression. Self-reinforcing cycle. Noticed in own behavior ("the AI will figure it out"). Related to cognitive offloading but distinct: offloading navigation loses a skill, but offloading intent expression may lose access to *what you actually want*. Position taken: expression is constitutive of intent, not just its output. If you can't express your intent, it's not fully yours — you don't know it. "Expression is the scene." Connects to: cognitive offloading, cognitive forcing functions (Sec 4.3), control-autonomy paradox (Sec 5.3), over-reliance.

## Concepts to Create (after reading)
- User-Facing Interpretability vs Mechanistic Interpretability (two layers of the same problem)

## Reading List (surfaced from this session)
- **Iain McGilchrist** — *The Master and His Emissary* — left/right hemisphere, attention to parts vs wholes. Arose from: your observation about holistic vs analytical modes in agentic interaction.
- **Marshall McLuhan** — *Understanding Media* ("the medium is the message") — how tools shape perception. Arose from: your question about technology shaping epistemology.
- **Neil Postman** — *Technopoly*, *Amusing Ourselves to Death* — cultural consequences of technological shifts. Arose from: same question.
- **Yuk Hui** — *The Question Concerning Technology in China*, *Recursivity and Contingency* — philosophy of technology, non-Western perspective on technological determinism. Arose from: same question.
- **Ben Shneiderman** — *Human-Centered AI* — the Direct Manipulation originator, argues for high automation + high control. Mentioned in the paper.
- **Andy Clark & David Chalmers** — "The Extended Mind" (1998) — cognition extends beyond the skull into tools and environment. Arose from: the interaction field observation.

## Open Loops

### Conference Decisions

- **Feb 13** — IUI Cyprus early bird registration deadline. Decision needed: attend or skip.
- **Mar 4** — CHI Barcelona early bird registration deadline. Decision needed: attend or skip. Verify Category I pricing.
- **~May 15** — HHAI Brussels early bird registration deadline. More time to decide.
- Before any ACM conference: buy ACM + SIGCHI membership ($130) to unlock member rates.

## Reading Progress
- Mapping the HAI Field: Read through Section 1 (Field Structure) and Section 2 (Institutional Landscape). Next: Section 3 (Modes of Interaction).

## Between Sessions
- Kindle: Reading McGilchrist's *The Master and His Emissary* — feeds the hemisphere/attention/holistic observations from this session
- Mobile capture: TBD — exploring options, will settle next session
- Conference deadlines approaching: Feb 10 decide on CHI workshops, Feb 11 decide on IUI
