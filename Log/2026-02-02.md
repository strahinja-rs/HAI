# Session 5: 2026-02-02

## What We Did
- Processed 8 iCloud backlog captures (all about research process/methodology)
- Ran Gemini Deep Research on "how Gemini Deep Research works" — analyzed the output, thinking process, and Google Docs export
- Compared Gemini vs Claude research outputs in detail (written to `1-Inbox/Comparison-Gemini-vs-Claude-Research.md`)
- Reviewed the meta-prompt strategy used to generate both research prompts
- Developed the full HAI research process and documented it (`Meta/Research-Process.md`)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: added interaction policy #6 (write substantial text to files, not terminal)
- Discussed research methodology needs — what "research" means for a practitioner-researcher
- Wrote and launched Gemini Deep Research prompt on qualitative research methodology
- Surfaced micro-phenomenology and Peter Dalsgaard (Aarhus University) as leads

## Human Observations

**Research tools as finding vs. analyzing:** Gemini is a breadth machine — good at landscape mapping and finding sources, weak at genuine analysis. Claude Research is better at structured analysis and source selection. Neither synthesizes — the original thinking (concept notes) came from human reactions to the material, not from the tools' output. Prompt design matters more than tool choice.

**The Snippet Trap:** Gemini Deep Research defaults to reading search snippets, not full pages. Its "100+ sources" claim is often 100 snippets. The `browser` tool for deep page reading exists but is expensive and used sparingly. Key mitigation: force specific URLs with explicit instructions to read full text.

**Phenomenological lens as natural research mode:** When reading the field map, the strongest observations (Friction Discernment, Interaction Field, AI Whisperers) weren't answering "what exists?" or "what does X mean?" — they were answering "what is it like to be inside this?" That's phenomenological inquiry. This is the human's natural lens and possibly the core of his research contribution.

**Micro-phenomenology resonance:** The method of re-living a moment step by step (rather than describing from memory) feels like how human's mind already works when designing products and thinking generally. Same pattern as Friction Discernment — discovering a formal concept that names something already being done.

**Research process meta-observation:** This session was itself an instance of the research process being developed. The question ("how should I research?") was researched using the tools being evaluated. Recursive — studying the research process with the research process.

## Clarifications
- Gemini Deep Research architecture: agentic loop (plan → search → synthesize → iterate), not traditional RAG
- `google:search` tool (snippets) vs `browser` tool (full page reads) — the key distinction in understanding Gemini's depth
- Claude Code web capabilities: WebSearch (shallow, snippet-based) + WebFetch (one URL at a time). Not a research tool — an analyst tool.
- Claude Research (claude.ai paid feature) is different from Claude Code's web search — agentic multi-step research vs manual one-at-a-time lookups

## Process Decisions
- Substantial text output goes to markdown files in vault, not terminal (CLAUDE.md policy #6)
- Research Process documented in `Meta/Research-Process.md` — living document
- Meta-prompt strategy formalized for generating research prompts tailored to each tool
- Two-tool workflow: Gemini for landscape/finding, Claude for depth/analysis, Claude Code for vault work

## Inbox State
- **New this session:** 8 backlog captures (moved to inbox), Gemini Deep Research report (3 versions), research prompt files (2), comparison analysis, Peter Dalsgaard about page
- **Unprocessed from before:** Interaction Design synthesis (Claude), conferences 2026, 3 other research syntheses, 2 epubs
- **New and unprocessed:** Methodology research report (`Refining Qualitative Research Plan for HCI.md`) — priority for next session

## Reading Progress
- Mapping the HAI Field: Complete (Session 4)
- Interaction Design synthesis: Not started
- Gemini Deep Research Practitioner's Guide: Read and analyzed this session
- Methodology research report: Received, not yet read

## Open Loops

### Next Session Priority
- [ ] Read and process the methodology research report (Gemini output)
- [ ] Retrieval exercise on seed concepts (skipped this session due to process work)

### Research Queue
- [ ] Read "Interaction Design in Human-AI Interaction" synthesis (Claude output)
- [ ] Read Microsoft HAX Toolkit and Google PAIR Guidebook
- [ ] Find and read: "Micro-Phenomenology as a Method for Studying User Experience in HCI" (Dalsgaard et al.)
- [ ] Targeted research on Scandinavian design research tradition (Aarhus, participatory design)

### Conference Decisions (Deadlines Approaching)
- [ ] Feb 12 — CHI Workshop position paper submission deadline
- [ ] Feb 13 — IUI Cyprus early bird registration deadline

### Tools/Infrastructure
- [ ] Build epub → markdown chapter splitter (when ready)
- [ ] Research methodology prompt for research methodology itself (queued)
