# Sessions 5 & 6: 2026-02-02

## What We Did
- Processed 8 iCloud backlog captures (all about research process/methodology)
- Ran Gemini Deep Research on "how Gemini Deep Research works" — analyzed the output, thinking process, and Google Docs export
- Compared Gemini vs Claude research outputs in detail (written to `1-Inbox/Comparison-Gemini-vs-Claude-Research.md`)
- Reviewed the meta-prompt strategy used to generate both research prompts
- Developed the full HAI research process and documented it (`Meta/Research-Process.md`)
- Updated CLAUDE.md: added interaction policy #6 (write substantial text to files, not terminal)
- Discussed research methodology needs — what "research" means for a practitioner-researcher
- Wrote and launched Gemini Deep Research prompt on qualitative research methodology
- Surfaced micro-phenomenology and Peter Dalsgaard (Aarhus University) as leads

## Human Observations

**Research tools as finding vs. analyzing:** Gemini is a breadth machine — good at landscape mapping and finding sources, weak at genuine analysis. Claude Research is better at structured analysis and source selection. Neither synthesizes — the original thinking (concept notes) came from human reactions to the material, not from the tools' output. Prompt design matters more than tool choice.

**The Snippet Trap:** Gemini Deep Research defaults to reading search snippets, not full pages. Its "100+ sources" claim is often 100 snippets. The `browser` tool for deep page reading exists but is expensive and used sparingly. Key mitigation: force specific URLs with explicit instructions to read full text.

**Phenomenological lens as natural research mode:** When reading the field map, the strongest observations (Friction Discernment, Interaction Field, AI Whisperers) weren't answering "what exists?" or "what does X mean?" — they were answering "what is it like to be inside this?" That's phenomenological inquiry. This is the human's natural lens and possibly the core of his research contribution.

**Micro-phenomenology resonance:** The method of re-living a moment step by step (rather than describing from memory) feels like how human's mind already works when designing products and thinking generally. Same pattern as Friction Discernment — discovering a formal concept that names something already being done.

**Research process meta-observation:** This session was itself an instance of the research process being developed. The question ("how should I research?") was researched using the tools being evaluated. Recursive — studying the research process with the research process.

## Clarifications
- Gemini Deep Research architecture: agentic loop (plan → search → synthesize → iterate), not traditional RAG
- `google:search` tool (snippets) vs `browser` tool (full page reads) — the key distinction in understanding Gemini's depth
- Claude Code web capabilities: WebSearch (shallow, snippet-based) + WebFetch (one URL at a time). Not a research tool — an analyst tool.
- Claude Research (claude.ai paid feature) is different from Claude Code's web search — agentic multi-step research vs manual one-at-a-time lookups

## Process Decisions
- Substantial text output goes to markdown files in vault, not terminal (CLAUDE.md policy #6)
- Research Process documented in `Meta/Research-Process.md` — living document
- Meta-prompt strategy formalized for generating research prompts tailored to each tool
- Two-tool workflow: Gemini for landscape/finding, Claude for depth/analysis, Claude Code for vault work

## Inbox State
- **New this session:** 8 backlog captures (moved to inbox), Gemini Deep Research report (3 versions), research prompt files (2), comparison analysis, Peter Dalsgaard about page

# Session 6: 2026-02-02

## What We Did
- Retrieval exercise on 4 seed concepts (Friction-Discernment, Stochastic-Epistemology, Turn-Based-Interface, Warm-Transparency)
- Read and processed methodology research report (Gemini Deep Research output on qualitative HAI methods)
- Created source note: `SRC-Gemini-2026-Qualitative-Research-Frameworks-HAI.md`
- Defined all frontmatter fields precisely (`Meta/Field-Definitions.md`), added reference to CLAUDE.md
- Registered for EPIC2026 Kickoff (Feb 4, online)
- Updated `Meta/Research-Process.md` with qualitative methods section (decision matrix, trustworthiness criteria, pitfalls)

## Human Observations

**Enactivism as foundation for Interaction Field:** Cognition arises between agent and environment, not inside either one. Each agent enacts its own cognitive domain. The interaction is where two cognitive domains meet. This maps directly to [[Interaction-Field]] — the field IS the overlap zone of two enacted cognitive domains. Varela, Thompson, Rosch (*The Embodied Mind*, 1991) is the root text.

**Enhanced / extended / replaced:** Three modes of AI augmentation. Enhanced = capacity amplified, you're still doing the work. Extended = boundary of what you can do shifts outward. Replaced = AI does it and you don't. [[Friction-Discernment]] = choosing which mode. [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] = what happens when "replaced" goes unnoticed.

**Somaesthetic outsourcing:** A stress monitor replacing internal sensation with an external score. Bodily version of Intent-Expression-Atrophy. Not a separate concept — a body-level instance of the same pattern.

**Method as scaffolding:** The artistic instinct resists over-methodologizing. Methodology should disappear when you're doing the work. "Methodolatry" (Janesick 1994) names this risk. The right relationship to methodology: know it exists so reviewers take your work seriously, but don't let it constrain the seeing.

**AI coding as collaborative extension:** The question isn't "should we use AI for pattern recognition?" but "how to extend human pattern recognition with AI's, without mistaking AI's pattern-matching for human understanding." Neither pure human coding nor pure AI coding — collaborative extension.

**Already doing it:** Guidance development = autobiographical design (Section 3.2 of report). This vault = autoethnography. The formal labels name what's already happening. The gap is documentation rigor, not practice.

## Clarifications
- Black box problem: can't explain how neural nets reach outputs. Phenomenological counter-narrative: study the encounter, not the mechanism. "The knowledge is in the encounter, not the mechanism."
- Enactivism: post-cognitivist view — cognition arises through dynamic interaction, not internal computation. Each agent enacts its own cognitive domain.
- Grounded Theory: data → open coding → axial coding → selective coding → theory. Let patterns emerge rather than impose hypotheses.
- Third Wave HCI (Bødker 2006): experience, meaning, emotion, values — beyond task efficiency. Where this research lives.
- Micro-phenomenology: explicitation interview technique (Vermersch). The interviewer guides the participant into evocation (re-living the moment). Skill is in the interviewer, not the participant.
- Uncanny valley (Mori 1970): discomfort when AI is almost-but-not-quite human. Connects to [[Warm-Transparency]] — the uncanny valley is what happens when you try to go human-like instead of warm-machine-like.

## Retrieval Results
- **Friction-Discernment:** Strong. Got core + gym analogy. Missed: developmental direction face ("choosing friction is choosing development").
- **Stochastic-Epistemology:** Solid core claim. Thin on historical pattern (clockwork → mechanism → information processing → ?). Missed: pre-Enlightenment ambiguity question.
- **Turn-Based-Interface:** Clear. Nailed parent/child with chat + unconstrained response space. Had dimensionality spectrum implicitly.
- **Warm-Transparency:** Strong. Glass analogy, rigid-vs-responsive reframe. Missed: the deception threat (warm transparency silently becomes warm deception as AI improves).
- **Overall:** All 4 consolidating. No status changes yet — check again next session.

## Process Decisions
- Frontmatter fields now precisely defined in `Meta/Field-Definitions.md`. Status tracks development, confidence tracks certainty — independent dimensions.
- Source notes for AI research reports: keep full text in the SRC note (no separate summary needed — the understanding work happens in the reading session, not in summarizing a summary)
- Research-Process.md updated with qualitative methods reference material (not separate concept notes for methodologies — they're reference, not claims)

## Reading Progress
- Methodology research report: **Complete** (processed to source note)
