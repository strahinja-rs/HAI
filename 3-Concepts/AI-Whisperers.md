# AI Whisperers

## Definition

AI whisperers are people whose cognitive disposition produces a qualitatively different experience of AI interaction — not more efficient, but more precise, granular, and phenomenologically deep. This is not a value judgment or a skill level. It's a different *kind* of interaction with the same system.

These people are more like poets than engineers. Also system designers. Context wizards.

## Candidate Traits

- Comfort with ambiguity and probability
- Strong expression and communication skills
- Metacognition — awareness of one's own thinking process
- Symbolic thinking
- Comfort with emergence — not needing to control every outcome
- Iterative refinement as a natural mode (loose intent-holding)

## The Arrival Analogy

Louise Banks in *Arrival* as the archetype: someone whose cognitive and linguistic disposition allows them to interface with a non-human intelligence in ways others cannot. Not because she's smarter, but because her mode of thinking is suited to the interaction.

## Key Aspects

- Not an economic class — this cuts across material categories
- Already visible in data: frontier AI workers at the 95th percentile use AI qualitatively differently, not just more
- The social implication: a new kind of stratification based on AI interaction aptitude
- Distinct from "prompt engineering skill" — this is about cognitive disposition, not technique

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Interaction-Field]] (whisperers may produce richer fields), [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] (whisperers may be more resistant to atrophy because they value expression), [[Friction-Discernment]] (the meta-skill of choosing friction may be one of the dispositions), [[User-Interpretability]] (the engineer vs. non-technical user observation — same system, different phenomenological experience based on what the human brings)
- Tensions with: democratization of AI (if this is innate, it creates a new inequality), accessibility goals

## Open Questions

- Learnable skill or innate disposition? Or some of each?
- Can education cultivate these traits, or only identify them?
- Does this class already exist informally, and we're just naming it?
- What is the relationship between these traits and existing psychological constructs (openness to experience, cognitive flexibility, etc.)?
