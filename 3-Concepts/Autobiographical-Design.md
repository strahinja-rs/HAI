# Autobiographical Design

## Definition

Autobiographical design is a research method where the researcher creates a system and then lives with it — using it daily, documenting the experience, and treating their own evolving relationship with the system as research data. The researcher is simultaneously the designer, the user, and the subject.

The rigor comes not from sample size but from depth of documentation: diaries, logs, annotated moments of friction, and the longitudinal arc of how the relationship changes over time. The goal is transferability — providing enough detail that others can see the patterns in their own contexts.

## Why It Matters for HAI

Standard user testing captures a snapshot: 60 minutes in a lab. Autobiographical design captures an arc: weeks, months, years of living with a system. This is crucial for HAI because:

- Trust in AI evolves over time — initial impressions are poor predictors of long-term relationship
- Adaptation and wear-in are invisible in short studies
- The researcher's own changing behavior (learning to prompt differently, developing workarounds, gradually offloading more) is the data

## The Guidance Case

Guidance (practice timer app) is an instance of autobiographical design:
- Designed a system for personal transformation practice
- Living with it daily
- The system evolves based on lived experience with it
- File-first architecture means the design decisions (what goes in a protocol file, what friction is built in, what the AI can and can't do) are all observable and documented
- The [[Friction-Discernment]] concept emerged directly from this process — designing friction into your own system IS friction discernment in action

## Key Aspects

- "Sample of one" — but the depth compensates for the breadth (Lucero, Desjardins — DIS 2019)
- Validity criterion: transferability, not generalizability
- Requires sustained meta-cognition — you must be in the experience AND watching yourself in the experience
- Risk: losing critical distance. Mitigation: the vault logs serve as externalized reflexivity
- Related to autoethnography but with a design artifact at the center

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Friction-Discernment]] (emerged from autobiographical design of Guidance — designing your own friction), [[Interaction-Field]] (the field between you and a system you built is uniquely intimate), [[Enactivism]] (you enact the system's domain by designing it, then the system enacts back on you)
- Method references: Lucero & Desjardins, "A Sample of One" (DIS 2019); Longitudinal First-Person HCI Research Methods (Lucero 2021)
- Tensions with: traditional user research (which requires external participants), objectivity norms (the researcher IS the subject)

## Open Questions

- How do you maintain critical distance from a system you built and love?
- When does autobiographical design become just "using your own product"? The difference is research intent and documentation rigor — but where's the line?
- Can the vault itself (this research process) be framed as autobiographical design of a knowledge system?
