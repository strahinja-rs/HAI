summary: Three distinct modes of AI augmentation — enhanced (stronger), extended (broader), replaced (absent) — with critical differences in what happens to the human's capacity.

# Augmentation Modes

## Definition

There are three distinct modes of AI augmentation. They are not a spectrum — they are qualitatively different in what happens to the human:

1. **Enhanced** — your capacity is amplified. You're still doing the work, but you're stronger at it. The boundary of what you can do stays the same; you do it better. *Example: AI catches your typos while you write. You're still writing.*

2. **Extended** — the boundary of what you can do shifts outward. You're not stronger — you're broader. You can now do things you couldn't before, reach into domains that were previously inaccessible. *Example: AI translates in real-time, letting you have a conversation in a language you don't speak. You couldn't do this at all before.*

3. **Replaced** — the AI does it instead of you. Your capacity doesn't grow or shift — it becomes unnecessary. The AI enacts a domain you used to enact. *Example: AI writes the email for you. You didn't get better at writing; you stopped writing.*

## The Critical Distinction: Enhanced vs. Extended

The difference between enhanced and extended is subtle but important:

- **Enhanced:** Same domain, more power. You were already operating here — now you operate better. Your skill is still engaged.
- **Extended:** New domain, new reach. You were NOT operating here — now you can. The AI gives you access to territory you didn't have before.

Enhanced preserves your existing capacity. Extended adds new capacity. Both keep the human in the loop. Replaced removes the human from the loop.

## Why This Matters

The mode determines what happens to the human over time:
- **Enhanced:** Capacity maintained or grown (the friction of doing the work is still there, AI just reduces noise)
- **Extended:** New capacity built (but only if you engage with the new domain, not just delegate to it)
- **Replaced:** Capacity atrophies ([[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]]) — unless the replacement is a deliberate [[Friction-Discernment]] decision

The same AI tool can operate in different modes depending on how you use it. ChatGPT helping you refine your argument = enhanced. ChatGPT writing your argument = replaced. The mode is in the use, not the tool.

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Friction-Discernment]] (choosing which mode = choosing where to keep friction), [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] (what happens when "replaced" goes unnoticed), [[Adjustable-Autonomy]] (autonomy level determines which mode you're in), [[Enactivism]] (enhanced = same enacted domain, extended = expanded enacted domain, replaced = surrendered enacted domain), [[Interaction-Field]] (field quality depends on both sides maintaining enacted domains)
- Tensions with: productivity framing (which treats all three modes as equally good because output is the same), the "AI as tool" metaphor (tools enhance; only agents replace)

## Open Questions

- Can replacement ever be the right choice? (Yes — [[Friction-Discernment]] says some friction isn't worth keeping. The question is whether the choice is conscious.)
- Is there a fourth mode? (Collaborative/co-creative — where the output couldn't exist from either side alone. May be a combination of enhanced and extended rather than a distinct mode.)
- At what point does "extended" become a dependency? (If the AI extends you into a domain and then is removed, do you collapse back or have you learned something?)
