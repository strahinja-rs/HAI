summary: A positive feedback loop — as AI improves at reading intent, humans express less, and the capacity to express (and therefore know) intent atrophies.

# Intent Expression Atrophy

## Definition

Intent expression atrophy is the positive feedback loop between AI's growing capacity to read intent and the reduction in human capacity to express it. The better AI gets at reading intent, the less humans need to express it fully. Humans tend toward frictionless behavior patterns — expressions become half-formed, the rest left to AI. Over time, the capacity for full intent expression itself atrophies.

## The Constitutive Claim

The load-bearing insight: expression is not merely the *output* of intent — it is *constitutive* of intent. You don't first know what you want and then express it. The act of expression is how you come to know what you want. When you stop expressing, you lose access to what you actually want. You become less integrated, less self-knowing.

"Expression is the scene" — not a report on the scene.

## The Loop

1. AI improves at reading intent from minimal input
2. Humans, seeking frictionlessness, express less
3. Half-formed expressions become the norm ("the AI will figure it out")
4. The skill of full expression atrophies from disuse
5. Humans become less knowledgeable about their own intent
6. Dependency on AI's intent-reading deepens
7. → Return to step 1

## Key Aspects

- Distinct from general cognitive offloading: offloading navigation loses a skill, but offloading intent expression may lose access to *what you actually want*
- Self-reinforcing: each cycle makes the next more likely
- Already observable: "the AI will figure it out" as a common stance among heavy AI users
- The disintegration is not dramatic — it's gradual, comfortable, and welcomed as convenience

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Friction-Discernment]] (intent expression as a friction worth keeping), [[User-Interpretability]] (if you can't express intent, you also can't evaluate AI output), [[Interaction-Field]] (the field quality degrades when one participant atrophies)
- Tensions with: convenience, efficiency, accessibility (lower expression barriers help some users)
- [Claude: connects to cognitive offloading literature broadly — your insight distinguishes this as a special case where what's offloaded isn't just a *skill* but access to *self-knowledge*]

## Open Questions

- Is there a threshold below which expression atrophy becomes irreversible?
- Can structured friction (e.g., AI asking "what do you actually want?" before acting) interrupt the loop without reintroducing full friction?
- Does this affect all domains equally, or is it worse for ambiguous/creative intent vs. instrumental intent?
