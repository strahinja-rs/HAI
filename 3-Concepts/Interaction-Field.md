summary: Human-AI interaction as a single contextual field — not two entities exchanging messages, but a unified entity that emerges from their engagement.

# Interaction Field

## Definition

When two entities interact, they are not merely exchanging messages — they are creating a field. The interaction field is this emergent entity: something more than the sum of its participants, shaped by both but belonging to neither alone.

In human-AI interaction, the field is the contextual space that updates itself based on the responses between the entities. It has its own dynamics, its own quality, its own trajectory.

## The Therapy Analogy

This is inspired by relational therapeutic modalities where the session itself is treated as an entity. The therapist doesn't just work *on* the client — they attend to the relational field *between* them. The quality of healing depends on the quality of this field, not just the skill of either participant.

Similarly, the quality of human-AI interaction depends on the quality of the field, not just the capability of the AI or the skill of the human.

## Extension or New Entity?

The central question: is the interaction field merely an *extension* of the human (the human + their tools), or is it something genuinely new — an entity with its own properties that can't be reduced to either participant?

This likely connects to the extended mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers) — to be explored once that concept is introduced.

### The Embodiment Test (Session 4)

Imagining an embodied AI sitting beside you: for "joint attention" to be real, the LLM needs to be always-on. But LLMs are fundamentally **reactive** — no input, no processing. To simulate continuous presence, a script must fire triggers continuously (e.g., every 100ms feeding sensory input). The "aliveness" is manufactured, not spontaneous.

This suggests the interaction field with current AI may be more **extension** than **field** — something synthetic and external that extends and amplifies the human's qualia, rather than creating a genuine shared entity. The AI pulls out phenomenological experience from the human rather than contributing its own.

### The Human's Lens Determines the Field

The same AI system produces different fields depending on what the human brings. A deep learning engineer and a non-technical user have fundamentally different phenomenological experiences with the same model — the engineer sees the machine, the non-technical user may experience something closer to a person. As models become more capable, fewer people will be in the "can distinguish" category.

This means field quality isn't just about capability — it's about the human's interpretive framework. Connects to [[AI-Whisperers]] (some people produce richer fields because of their cognitive disposition).

## Key Aspects

- Shifts focus from "how good is the AI?" and "how skilled is the user?" to "how good is the field between them?"
- The field is contextual — the same human and same AI produce different fields in different contexts
- Both participants contribute to field quality: [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] degrades the human's contribution, poor AI design degrades the AI's contribution
- Goes beyond "distributed agency" (which still implies two separate actors distributing control) toward something more unified
- The human's knowledge and interpretive lens shapes the field as much as the AI's capability

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] (field quality depends on both participants maintaining capacity), [[Friction-Discernment]] (friction choices shape the field), [[User-Interpretability]] (interpretability enables richer field dynamics), [[AI-Whisperers]] (cognitive disposition shapes field quality), [[Adjustable-Autonomy]] (autonomy level shapes the field dynamics)
- To explore: Extended Mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers, 1998), intersubjective field traditions in psychotherapy
- [Claude: "distributed agency" as insufficient framing is your original critique — most HAI literature still uses two-agent models]

## Open Questions

- Does this require consciousness on both sides to be a genuine field, or does it work with one conscious + one responsive participant?
- Can field quality be measured? What would the indicators be?
- Does the field persist across sessions, or is it created fresh each time? (Context windows suggest the latter for AI, but humans carry the field forward in memory)
- Is "joint attention" with AI real if the AI's attention is manufactured (script-triggered) rather than spontaneous? Does the mechanism matter, or only the phenomenological experience?
- As models become indistinguishable from humans for most users, does the extension-vs-field question become moot in practice?
