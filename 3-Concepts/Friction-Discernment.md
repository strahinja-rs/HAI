summary: The meta-skill of choosing where to maintain friction and where to eliminate it — choosing friction is choosing development.

# Friction Discernment

## Definition

Friction discernment is the meta-skill of choosing where to apply friction in one's life and where to eliminate it. In the age of AI, we will increasingly be able to remove all cognitive friction. This skill has two faces: preventing atrophy on one hand, and choosing a developmental direction on the other.

**Choosing our own friction is choosing our own development.**

## Why This Is New

Every major tool has eliminated some friction and introduced this question implicitly. Plato (in *Phaedrus*) argued that writing would atrophy memory — and he was right; it did. But historically, some friction has always remained imposed. You couldn't choose *all* your frictions.

AGI-level AI is different because it targets *cognitive* friction specifically — the kind that shapes thinking, judgment, and identity. When cognitive friction becomes optional across the board, the choice of where to keep it becomes a defining life skill.

## The Gym Analogy

We already do this with physical friction. No one *needs* to run or lift weights — machines and vehicles eliminated that necessity. But we choose physical friction because we understand it develops us. The same logic now applies to cognitive friction: writing when you could dictate, reasoning when you could ask, remembering when you could look up.

## Key Aspects

- Not just a UX design principle ([[Cognitive-Forcing-Functions]]) — it's a life skill, a stance toward one's own development
- Operates at individual, organizational, and societal levels
- Requires self-knowledge: you must know where you want to develop to choose friction wisely
- Creates a dependency on [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]]: if you've already atrophied in knowing what you want, you can't choose friction well

## Friction Discernment vs. Cognitive Forcing Functions

The key distinction is **perspective**:
- **Friction Discernment** = individual meta-skill — I choose where to keep friction for myself
- **[[Cognitive-Forcing-Functions]]** = design pattern — a designer imposes friction on other users

They converge when the user is their own designer — e.g., building Guidance, where you design friction protocols for yourself. This convergence is where **ontological design** applies (Anne-Marie Willis, Heidegger): we design tools, and those tools design us back. Designing your own friction is designing who you become.

In education, the student is NOT their own designer — the teacher/system decides where friction goes. This creates a tension between what the user wants (frictionless) and what's good for the user (forced thinking).

## Connections

- Related concepts: [[Cognitive-Forcing-Functions]] (system design counterpart), [[Intent-Expression-Atrophy]] (intent expression as a specific friction worth keeping), [[User-Interpretability]] (explanation as productive friction), [[Interaction-Field]] (field quality depends on both participants maintaining capacity), [[Adjustable-Autonomy]] (choosing autonomy level IS a friction discernment decision)
- Historical precedent: Plato's *Phaedrus* on writing and memory; Postman's concerns about television and discourse
- Ontological Design (Anne-Marie Willis, Heidegger) — designing friction that designs you back

## Open Questions

- How do you choose friction wisely when you don't yet know what you'll need? (The bootstrapping problem)
- Can institutions or education systems teach friction discernment, or is it inherently personal?
- Is there a risk of friction discernment itself becoming a class marker — those who can afford to choose friction vs. those who can't?
